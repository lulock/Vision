# Let's have some fun with Python and computer vision :)

Starting by importing some libraries
```python
from PIL import Image
import numpy as np
import math
from scipy import signal
import urllib2, cStringIO
```
The first couple of convolutions to discover is with the use of 
- a boxfilter that blurs by averaging
- a 2d gaussian filter
- a sharpening boxfilter

###Now, here's the image in grayscale (top left), sharpened using a boxfilter (top right), blurred with a 2d Gaussian filter (bottom left), and blurred using a boxfilter (bottom right):
